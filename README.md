# AI Talent Workshop - Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering

This project is part of the AI Talent Workshop and focuses on practical data wrangling skills, including data pre-processing and feature engineering using Python and pandas.

## Overview
These two workshops will guide you through using the Pandas library for a real-world problem: identifying and potentially recruiting AI talent. You will practice data gathering (from multiple sources), wrangling, cleaning, transforming, and feature engineering. We will use active learning to make this an interactive and collaborative experience.


## Project Structure

- **AI_talent_workshop_challenge.ipynb**: Introduction to the workshop.
- **AI_talent_workshop_part1.ipynb**: Load from multiple sources using Pandas and merge into a unified DataFrame.
- **AI_talent_workshop_part2.ipynb**: Main notebook for data loading, cleaning, and feature engineering tasks.
- **candidate_profiles.csv**: Candidate profile data.
- **technical_assessments.csv**: Technical assessment results.
- **merged_ai_data.csv**: Merged dataset (created during the workshop).

## Workshop Tasks

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and address missing data in the merged dataset.
2. **Data Type Conversion and Cleaning**: Ensure all columns have appropriate data types and clean any inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing data to enhance analysis.
4. **Collaborative Analysis**: Discuss and analyze the impact of pre-processing steps and engineered features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and pandas installed.
3. Run the notebooks `AI_talent_workshop_part1.ipynb` and `AI_talent_workshop_part2.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
