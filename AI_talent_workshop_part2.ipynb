    "### AI Talent Workshop - Day 2: Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Practice data cleaning, transformation, and basic feature engineering on the merged AI talent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructional Technique:** Jigsaw, Team-Based Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials:**\n",
    "1.  **Interactive Notes:** Google Colaboratory Notebook 2 (will be shared)\n",
    "2.  **Workshop:** Jupyter Notebook 2 (`AI_talent_workshop_part2.ipynb`) and the (potentially saved) merged dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **(20 minutes):** Review the merged DataFrame from Wednesday and introduce various data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques using Google Colab Notebook 2.\n",
    "2.  **(60 minutes):** You will work on Workshop 2 using the `AI_talent_workshop_part2.ipynb` notebook. You will be divided into three initial groups:\n",
    "    * **Group A:** Focuses on identifying and handling missing values in the merged data.\n",
    "    * **Group B:** Focuses on examining data types and performing any necessary cleaning or conversions (e.g., standardizing experience levels if needed).\n",
    "    * **Group C:** Focuses on basic feature engineering – creating new relevant features from the existing data. For example, you might think about creating a feature that combines skills or flags highly experienced candidates.\n",
    "    Each group will work on their assigned task.\n",
    "3.  **(20 minutes):** You will form new teams with at least one member from each of the initial groups. Each member will share their findings and the code they used. Your new team will then collaboratively discuss the impact of each pre-processing step and explore further feature engineering possibilities relevant to identifying top AI talent.\n",
    "4.  **(10 minutes):** Final group discussion where each team shares their insights on the pre-processing and feature engineering steps, and we discuss how these steps prepare the data for potential machine learning models.\n"
