    "**Goal:** To practice merging datasets that do not share a direct common identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials:**\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook: `advanced_merging.ipynb`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Merge the `candidate_details.csv` and `assessment_results.csv` datasets. These datasets do not have a direct common identifier. You will likely need to use the 'CandidateName' from `candidate_details.csv` and the 'FullName' from `assessment_results.csv` to perform the merge. Consider the challenges this might present, such as variations in names (e.g., capitalization, extra spaces) and potential mismatches. Document your approach and any data cleaning steps you take to facilitate the merge.\n",
